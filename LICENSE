### 2. Create a Python Directory with Gold Standard

Create a file at `python/fixed_point_asg.py` with the Python gold standard implementation you've already tested.

### 3. Add a Development Environment Setup File

Create `docs/development_setup.md`:

```markdown
# Development Environment Setup

This document outlines the steps to set up your environment for working with the Arithmetic Signal Generator project.

## FPGA Development Tools

### Vivado/Quartus Setup
1. Download and install Xilinx Vivado / Intel Quartus (version X.X)
2. Set up a new project with target device: (your FPGA board)
3. Import the RTL files from the `/rtl` directory

### Simulation Tools
1. Install ModelSim/Questasim/VCS/other simulator
2. Add simulation files from `/rtl/testbench`

## Python Environment Setup

1. Install Python 3.x
2. No special packages required for the basic gold standard

## OpenCL Environment (Section Two)
